# Pajarito-Examples

![Main graphical](./rcs/sample.gif)

This is a set of examples using the [Pajarito](https://github.com/calaverd/PajaritoPathfinder), a pathfinder library.

To run the examples you will need to clone this repo and have [love2d](https://love2d.org/) in your path. Then navigate to the directory and run:

```bash
    love .
```
You can see their code in the `examples` directory. Notice that the examples try to ignore the graphical boilerplate to focus on the relevant showcase of the library.
